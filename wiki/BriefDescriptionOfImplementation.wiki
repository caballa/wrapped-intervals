=Brief Description of the Implementation=

We provide two LLVM passes: -range-analysis and -wrapped-range-analysis. The former corresponds to the classical fixed-width interval analysis and the latter to our wrapped interval analysis. 

The implementation contains the main following classes:

* FixpointSSI. This class implements an *intraprocedural* generic forward    
  abstract interpreter. Generic in the sense that it calls only methods   
  from the class virtual AbstractValue. To plug  a new abstract domain  
  should not be too hard. It should suffice to implement the methods from 
  AbstractValue. 
 
* AbstractValue
* BaseRange
* Range
* WrappedRange
