=Brief Description of the Implementation=

We provide two LLVM passes: -range-analysis and -wrapped-range-analysis. The former corresponds to the classical fixed-width interval analysis and the latter to our wrapped interval analysis.

The implementation contains the following classes:

- FixpointSSI
- AbstractValue
- BaseRange
- Range
- WrappedRange
